Etta James (born Jamesetta Hawkins, January 25, 1938 – January 20, 2012) was one of the most significant blues singers of the modern era. Music producer Gerald "Jerry" Wexler described her as "the greatest of all contemporary blues singers," a title she richly deserved through a six-decade career spanning blues, R&B, soul, rock and roll, jazz, and gospel.

## Early Life and Career

Born in Los Angeles, James showed musical talent from age five, performing gospel in church choirs and on radio. At 12, she relocated to San Francisco and formed the doo-wop trio The Creolettes. By 1954, she recorded with Otis, achieving immediate success with a song initially titled "Roll with Me, Henry" but rebranded as "The Wallflower" due to suggestive content for mainstream radio.

## Rise to Fame

After signing with Chess Records in 1960, James released acclaimed ballads including the famous "At Last," establishing herself as a versatile artist capable of both tender vocals and energetic rock-gospel numbers like "Something's Got a Hold On Me" (1962).

## Later Career and Legacy

Despite struggles with heroin addiction, she continued recording through the 1970s and beyond. Following gastric bypass surgery in 2003, her vocal range expanded, leading to Grammy wins for "Let's Roll" (2003) and "Blues to the Bone" (2004). She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.

The singer passed away on January 20, 2012, at age 73. Keith Richards wrote that she possessed "a voice that could lead you to hell or to heaven."
